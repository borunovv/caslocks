# caslocks
Welcome!

This is my R&D project to learn how simple synchronization primitives work. 
I used own implementation of semaphore paradigm via CAS (compare and swap). 
And then use it in more high-level primitives like Barrier, BoundedConcurrentQueue, Fifo, ReadWriteLock, ReadWriteNoStarvateLock.

Please feel free to use my code for any goals.
